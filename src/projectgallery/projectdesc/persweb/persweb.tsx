        Welcome to my personal website! This site is built using React and TypeScript. It serves as a platform to showcase my personal projects, my goals in computer science, and my journey in web development.

        The website is styled using CSS and includes various sections such as an about page, a gallery of my artwork, and a project gallery where I document my software development projects.
